# 🎓 Student Profile Dashboard
A collaborative project built using JavaScript-powered web dashboard that lets users add, edit, and view student profiles — built by our team as part of a hands-on JavaScript learning project (Days 1–10).

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Student Profile Dashboard** is a lightweight, interactive web app designed to help users manage student data. This includes features like listing students, viewing summary stats, and adding/editing student profiles — all using core JavaScript concepts.

---

## Features

- 🏠 **Dashboard Overview**: Displays all students with basic stats (total, average progress, etc.)
- ➕ **Add/Edit Form Page**: Input student name, age, and subjects via an interactive form.
- 📊 **Data Summary**: Real-time updates to student list and basic insights.
- 🌙 **Dark Mode Toggle** (Optional Bonus)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – semantic and accessible
- **CSS3** – clean and responsive UI
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – handles logic, events, DOM manipulation, and data flow

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

This project puts into practice everything we've learned so far:
- Variables and data types
- Loops and conditionals
- Functions (declaration, expressions, arrow)
- Arrays and objects
- DOM manipulation
- Event listeners
- ES6 features (destructuring, template literals, etc.)

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User visits the dashboard
2. JS fetches student data (from an array or local storage)
3. Dashboard displays stats + list of students
4. User clicks "Add New Student"
5. User fills out form and submits
6. JS validates and updates the student array
7. Redirects back to updated dashboard
